   <h1>Stone Age</h1>
   <img src="images/1.png" alt="">
   <p> <b>The Stone Age</b> was a broad prehistoric period during which stone was widely used to make tools with an edge, a point, or a percussion surface. The period lasted for roughly <i> 3.4 million years,</i> and ended between 4,000 BCE and 2,000 BCE, with the advent of metalworking. Though some simple metalworking of malleable metals, particularly the use of gold and copper for purposes of ornamentation, was known in the Stone Age, it is the melting and smelting of copper that marks the end of the Stone Age. In Western Asia, this occurred by about 3,000 BCE, when bronze became widespread. The term Bronze Age is used to describe the period that followed the Stone Age, as well as to describe cultures that had developed techniques and technologies for working copper alloys <strong> (bronze: originally copper and arsenic, later copper and tin) </strong>into tools, supplanting stone in many uses. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Age" target="_blank">Read More</a></p>
